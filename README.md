RMINDD - Radiation-Matter Interaction and Damage calculation using Nuclear Data
RMINDD is a package of computer programs written in Python programming language. It can read the recent basic evaluated nuclear data libraries such as ENDF/B-VII.1, ENDF/B-VIII.0, TENDL-2023, etc. to estimate the quantities that determine the primary radiation damage in structural materials such as Fe, Ni, Cr, Si, W, etc. used in nuclear applications. The basic features of this program so far developed are distributed here for academic and scientific use. Future developments are possible and will be available here once developed and tested. This README file also be updated as when required.
